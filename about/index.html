			<h1>About</h1>
			<p>I am originally from Southern California, but now live in the Bay Area.I am finishing my last year at UC Berkeley as a Computer Science major.  I am passionate about exploring, learning, and creating.  As a soon-to-be grad, I look forward to working in a passionate and creative environment, with people who enjoy developing meaningful and impactful software.</p>
      			<p>This summer, I interned at CircleCI, a continuous integration platform.  I loved interning there; I found it amazing that collaboration was highly valued and practiced.  After I graduate, I hope to work at a company or startup who values collaboration, team work, and are passionate about their mission.</p>

      			<p>I fell in love with the Bay after living here for 2 years (That is how long it took...jaja, kidding).  I initially did not love it much.  Why?  I was simply not used to the environment.  People are very different, I did not know anyone, etc.   However, With the right people and awesome adventure plans, I learned how beautful the Bay is.  I love the various trails one can explore, like Mnt. Tam.  I love the diversity. </p>  
      			&nbsp;
			<p>Fun facts:  I love training, combat sports, lifting, and trail running.  I love food, dogs, and grape green tea.</p>

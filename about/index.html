<div class="about">
	<h1>About</h1>
	<p>I am originally from Compton, Southern California, but now live in beautiful Berkeley, Northern California. I
		graduated from Cal in May 2018 in Computer Science, and I am a Software Engineer at <a href="https://circleci.com/">CircleCI</a></p>
	<p>I fell in love with the Bay after living here for 2 years (That is how long it took...jaja, kidding). My favorite
		part about the Bay Area is how many beautiful trails there are! </p>
	<p>I love exploring new restaurants, cities, and trails. I love staying active through combat sports, lifting,
		and running. I recently got into yoga and meditation, and as clich√© as it may sound, meditation and yoga have
		impacted my life in so many positive ways! Definitely staying active, whether through hitting a bag, or doing yoga,
		has allowed me to navigate life in a more peaceful and mindful way.</p>

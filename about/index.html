<div class="about">
	<h1>About</h1>
	<p>I am originally from Compton, Southern California, but now live beautiful Berkeley, Northern California. I
		graduated from Cal in May 2018 in Computer Science, and I am a Software Engineer at <a href="https://circleci.com/">CircleCI</a></p>
	<p>I fell in love with the Bay after living here for 2 years (That is how long it took...jaja, kidding). My favorite
		part about the Bay Area is how many beautiful trails there are! </p>
	<p>I love exploring new restaurants, cities, and trails. I love staying active throughh combat sports, lifting,
		and running. I recently got into yoga and meditation, and as cliché as it may sound, meditation and yoga have
		impacted my life in so many positive ways! Definitrly staying active, weather through hitting a bag, or doing yoga,
		has allowed me to navigate life in a more peaceful and mindful way</p>

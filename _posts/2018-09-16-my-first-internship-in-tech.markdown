I had been recruiting since my junior year as an undergrad. I went to various conferences and recruiting events. Sadly, most of my experience recruiting left me feeling discouraged--most of the interviewing processes made me question if I even wanted to work there. My internship at [CircleCI](https://circleci.com/) began on May 2017. Interning there made me realize how rare its culture is: a culture of collaboration across the world, transparency, supportive learning environment and teamwork. After my internship ended, I knew that I did not want to work anywhere else. My internship ended in August 2017 and I was offered a positing in January 2018. And...Of course I accepted the offer!

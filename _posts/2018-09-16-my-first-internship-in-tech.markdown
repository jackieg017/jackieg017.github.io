As an undergrad, I began recruiting around my sophmore year. I attended various conferences and recruiting events. Sadly, a good amount of my experiences in recruiting left me feeling discouraged--the interviewing processes made me question my desire for entering the tech world and whether I would ever find a postive working environment. My internship at [CircleCI](https://circleci.com/) began on May 2017. While interning there I was exposed to a culture of collaboration across the world, transparency, supportive learning environments and teamwork. By the end of my internship I knew where I wanted to begin my career as a Software Engineer. My internship ended in August 2017 and I was offered a position in January 2018. And...Of course I accepted the offer!
